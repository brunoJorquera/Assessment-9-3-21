"How does the internet work? What happens when you click on a link?"

        To answer the first question, the internet is a series of networks ranging from a few small networks to many larger ones.
    These networks consist of many computers that communicate with one another using responses and requests.
    The internet as a whole is a path for communication between these computers. This communication is a transfer of data that takes place physically or by signals.
    When a link is clicked a request is made, a server (computer hosting a database of back-end and front-end info) sends a response back to the user.
    This link can be accessed through a URL that consists of a protocol (http or https) and is linked to a domain. This domain is further linked by an endpoint (/info-about-something).

      In this module I have come to understand that through the series of many requests and responses, everything we see on a simple page can be linked to these very requests and responses.
    I have also learned that there are secure ways of accessing websites and unsecure ways as well, this is most commonly seen with http(s).
    This week we also were taught concerning ports and the importance of how these ports connect us to servers through the internet.
    We also learned more about URL's and their functions, how they can be manipulated and how the DOM can also be manipulated.
